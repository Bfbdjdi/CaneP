My first fullscale C++ project: Minesweeper. 

The rules are exactly the same as in the original game, but:
1. No GUI, everything is displayed in a CMD window;
2. Consequently, no buttons to be found - no mouse needed, only a keyboard is required.

My skills in programming are LOW, so, please, don't hurt yourself the moment you facepalm hard while reading my source code.
Still, the game (in Russian "Minesweeper" is written as "Сапёр") works really fine, i have tried hard to mimic the original game as good as i could. If there is no internet on your enterprise PC, this game can actually help you spend some time!

At this point, there is only an x86 version of the game for Windows only. Perhaps, in the future i'll make an adequate GUI and versions for other OSs and CPUs.

Will be glad to receive some help to improve the app
